# My Experience @GNDEC

**Day 1:**

My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

An alumnus, now a PCS officer, emphasized the importance of understanding 'My Why' – the golden question of why we do what we do. He explained that as engineers, we are creators and must always ask ourselves "Why?" before "How?" or "What?" This approach, he said, leads to greater success.

I learned an essential lesson: "Seize the opportunity; don't wait for it to come to you."

***The PCS officer then pulled out a 500 rupee note and asked who wanted it. No one moved at first, but he repeated his offer, urging someone to come up and take it. Despite my inner urge to go, I hesitated due to overthinking. Eventually, someone else took the note, and the audience applauded. I repent.***

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: "Don't be easily impressed; there's always more to learn."

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on 500 rupees and chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again and walked the 4 kilometers home as a self-imposed lesson.

**Day 2:**

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Thindgra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. Rai sought 10 students to work with him – not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

**Day 3:**

We learned Canva in an exciting, hands-on Class Workshop organized by the [Causmic Club](https://causmic.gndec.ac.in). Instead of taking plain text notes, we used our phones to follow along and create. I enjoyed it so much that **I gave a video feedback after the lecture**.

Later, we had a maths session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.
